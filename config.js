    bio: "Passionate software engineer specializing in high-performance applications, backend systems, and enterprise solutions using .NET and C++.",
    aboutDescription: `I'm a software developer with expertise in .NET development as well as C++ (although a bit rusty - pun intended). 
        I enjoy building high-performance business applications and designing robust and scalable backend architectures. 
        My passion lies in writing clean, efficient code to ensure maintainability and solving complex technical challenges.
        I'm an architect, not a coder.`,
